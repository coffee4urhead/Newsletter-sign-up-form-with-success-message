This is a html,css ans JS based example for front-end challenge i accepted recently.

### Skills I Learnes Throughout this challenge ###
---[One of the main challenges i faced was creating and implementing a responsible web design.]---
---[Although i found it hard i will be happy to hear your personal view on things especially when developing responsible websites]---

### What i will be working on further through my experience with the front-end ###
---[The main points i would like to gain furthermore knowledge is by far the responsible web builds]---
---[I want to take a look at the JavaScript DOM and find out unique manipulation techniques and navigating through the DOM]---
---[I would also like to learn all of the css functions and properties that are not found directly in any tutorials:
--- most commonly found in css references unlike the main tutorials and this will take a lot of practise through the projects i create --
]---

### Found aspirations in: ... ###
---[I would like to thank on the first place SoftUni where i firstly met head-to-head with real programming languages and techniques]---
---[I would also find aspiration in w3schools where you can find a lots of different tutorials and references with code examples]---
---[I would like to thank Kevin Powell for making all those css tutorials and guides, because without him i would have thought that css
--- is nearly as impossible as i had imagined it!
